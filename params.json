{"name":"Javatest","tagline":"Something dumb","body":"#JavaTest\r\n\r\nThis application is my final project for CSC 111.  The goal was to write a GUI application that would quiz the user on Java related questions.\r\n\r\n##Questions\r\n\r\nThe questions are hosted on Github [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Commador/JavaTestQuestions/master/questions.json).  They are written in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format, and are then interpreted programmatically.\r\n\r\n##Compiling\r\n\r\nSee [here](COMPILING.md)\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\nWhile the project does depend on the [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) library and the [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) library, both of these dependencies are handled by Gradle's dependency management.  The source ships with a Gradle wrapper, so there should be no concern over whether or not you have Gradle installed.\r\n\r\n##Licensing\r\n\r\nSee [here](LICENSE.md)\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\n* Tim Miller - Primary developer\r\n* Google - Development of the Guava and GSON libraries\r\n* Gradleware - Development of Gradle, which has made dependency management and build distribution so much easier and so much harder\r\n* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - A fantastic community that I've relied on for years\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
