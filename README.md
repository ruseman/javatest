JavaTest
========
This application is my final project for CSC 111.  The goal was to write a GUI application that would quiz the user on Java related questions.

Questions
-
The questions are hosted [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Commador/JavaTestQuestions/master/questions.json).  They are written in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format, and are then interpreted programmatically.

Dependencies
-
While the project does depend on the [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) library and the [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) library, both of these dependencies are handled by Gradle's dependency management.  The source ships with a Gradle wrapper, so there should be no concern over whether or not you have Gradle installed.
