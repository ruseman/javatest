JavaTest
========
Final project for CSC 111 
 
Questions
-
The questions are hosted [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Commador/JavaTestQuestions/master/questions.json)

Dependencies
-
While the project does depend on the [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) library and the [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) library, both of these dependencies are handled by Gradle's dependency management.  The source ships with a Gradle wrapper, so there should be no concern over whether or not you have Gradle installed.
