<p>This simple Java application tests the user on a series of questions specified in a certain file stored online.</p>
<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
<p>This application relies on several 3rd party software technologies, including but not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradle, a buildscript system</li>
<li>Ant, a scripting system, implemented in Gradle</li>
<li>Guava, a Google utility library</li>
<li>JSON, JavaScript Objective Notation</li>
<li>GSON, a Google implementation of a JSON interpreter for Java</li>
<li>VoxioLib, a WIP Java utility library authored by me</li>
</ul>
<p>The GUI is rendered using the Java Abstract Window Toolkit and Swing Toolkit.</p>

<p>The game itself is simple enough.  The player begins with 10 points.  A correct answer rewards the player with one point, and an incorrect answer costs one point.  If the player runs out of points, then they&#39;ve lost.  If they make it through all of the questions with a positive number of points, they&#39;ve won.  There&#39;s not a whole lot more to it than that.</p>
